# YouTube Clone with some Additional Features

I have made a YouTube clone with channel creation, video upload functionality along with focusing on enhancing the functionality and user experience of a web application by implementing several key features. These features included creating a rich text editor for posting questions, developing a public space page for content sharing with abusive content filtering, enabling users to add custom avatars, and integrating a custom video player with gesture-based controls.
